# Workout tracking and communication application
This is my Senior project. It is a cross platform mobile application to assist in the tracking of the workouts that a player does, as well as give coaches a platform for both IOS and Android to see workouts without experiencing any troubles because a certain platform is being used. This is going to be an ongoing project to help any coach and athlete at any level improve their ability to track their workouts and have a convenitent space for them to access that information.

This application can be used at all levels of competition:
- Personal trainers
- Middle school coaches
- High school coaches
- College coaches
- Professional Teams
